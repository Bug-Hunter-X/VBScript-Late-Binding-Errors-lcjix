This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript programming related to late binding. Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to runtime errors if the referenced object or method does not exist. The example shows a scenario where a typo in the method name results in a failure that can be hard to track.  The solution provides a way to mitigate this by using early binding or error handling.
